			<p> This phenomenon could also be said as a formation, or collection of false memories. Many people constantly talk about their memories. What the may not know is that sometimes, what they remember, is not what actually happened. Their memories are not always the truth. Alternate universes connecting in the present is something theorists say about the mandela effect. Instead, doctors say that even though some memories may be remembered vivdly, they could still sometimes be false.
			</p>
	
			<p>There are many situations of why the false memories occur. The two most common reasons is trauma and sleep deprivation. People who&rsquo;ve experienced past trauma, are found to be a group of people who are specifically vunerable to be having false memories.

			<p> Confabulations is another theory under false memories whcih can be realted to the Mandela Effect. False statements or in this case false memories are what confabulations are. These false memories and statements that are being said, have no supporting evidence or any facts at all to support their statements. Confabulations is actually a common symptom of brain condications relating to memory loss. For example, conditions like Alzheimers and dementia. When someone with one of these conditions confabulates, their intentions are not negative. Instead, they really have no knoledge or information of what they're saying is accurate, they&rsquo;re unable to explain the event accurately despite what they&rsquo;re trying to say.
