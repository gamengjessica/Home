			<h3 class="sub-heading"> The Mandela Effect&rsquo;s Origin </h3>
			<p> This wonder came to be in the year 2009 When Fiona Broome had made a website of her own, to talk about this so called &ldquo;Mandela Effect&rdquo;. Fiona was at a meeting having a conversation about the death of the south afrrican president who had passed away in prison, back in the 1980s. Everyone with Fiona had remembered this exact event happening. They all said they saw it on the News. They later found out that president Nelson Mandela had not died and instead passed in 2013. Fiona was stunned on the fact that so many people had remembred the exact same event while the event had never even existed. She called this the &ldquo;Mandela Effect&rdquo; and created a website where she would elaborate on this occurence and other events like this one. She called it the <a href="https://mandelaeffectsite.wordpress.com/"> MandelaEffectSite. </a> </p>
