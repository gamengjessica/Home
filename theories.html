			<p> There are many theories about the mandela effect. Some are more popular than others, espicially the ones about having an alternate universe.

			<p> This theory is about having mulitple universes and which the Mandela Effect occurs this universe and this reality begins to interact with other realities and parallel universes. There are people that believe that there are endless universes that are very alike to ours and that we are able to switch between these universes. Shifting in and out of them whenever. That this timeline we're in is just in a constant state of a dream or "flux".
			</p>
	
			<h4 id = "StringTheory" class="sub-heading"> String Theory </h4>
			<p> The string theory and quantum physics is where all the different concepts of alternate realities came to be. The structure of the theory explains the universe and the formality of reality constructed by tiny strings that  vibrate in ten dimensions.

			<h4 id = "TimeTravelers" class="sub-heading"> Time Travelers </h4>
			<p> Another theory suggested that time travellers had messed with the timeline of this reality. Of course, these are all just made up theories that people have made to try and make sense of the Mandela Effect.
			</p>
	
			<h4 id = "FakeNews" class="sub-heading"> Fake News </h4>
			<p> Now this isn't really a theory. Giving out fake news is another reason on why some people may believe something differently than the truth. Maybe a super famous actor had passed away and you heard this by a random person telling their friend. Then you now go telling all your friends this disheartening news. Your friends believe you and your all just stuck with unbearable news that isn&rsquo;t even true. Although this may not get a huge group of people to start talking about it to even classify it as the mandela effect but sure is causing alot of fake memories.
	
	
			<p> There are all of these theories and maybe you can&rsquo;t really understand how unrealistic this is. Especially all this alternate universe talk. There are many people like us who just can&rsquo;t get a hold of these explanations. That being said, we can&rsquo;t understand why this happens so we&rsquo;re including all the theories we can, despite it being a little unbelieveable. Plus, it brings a little bit of excitment and fun into this phenomenon.
